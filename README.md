This was intended to become a tool to automatically level up or level down enemies in the video game _Temple of Elemental Evil_. I got pretty far into development, but quit when I encountered a roadblock WRT backtracking through a  character's upgrade "history" and determining the correct number of skill points based on the character's ability score modifier. Since a character can gain points in intelligence, a character's ability score modifier also changes over time.
